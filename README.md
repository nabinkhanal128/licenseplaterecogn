License plate recognition using Yolov9 and CNN
This project focus on Nepali License Plate Detection. The process involve in Object Detection, Segmentation and finally Optical Character Recognition. For object detection and object segmentation Yolov9 was used and for character reading CNN was used.

# System Architecture
Yolov9 was used for object detection i.e. license plate detection as well as segmentation.
For character reading simple CNN model was used.
